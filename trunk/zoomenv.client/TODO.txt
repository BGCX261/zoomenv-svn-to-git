- Creating a CS from scratch does not save correctly
- When changing layout of a YElement, it gets into an infinite loop updating the model (solved?)
- Setting width or height to 0 makes the canvas to disappear when using ListLayout


x Center alone nodes in YMatrixLayout 
x ZUI attributes in CS model

- Support for deleting EObjects in the YModelEditor

////////////////////////////////////////
Connections seem to be working in the model editor
- Tested using a EReference bw two EClasses

It remains to be tested in two situations:
- An association EObject that is not a child of one of the associated nodes
- YConnectionEnds referencing structural features from connected nodes rather than from the association EObject itself


******

Improvements:
Visualization should be fine-grained-related to model:
- It should be able to visualize any model element
   * Visualize the node that represents that model element
   * Visualize all of the connections and other nodes that are related to that element
   * Update visualizations of the node or its connections and connected nodes whenever the state of the model element changes
- Attribute-wise binding notifications
